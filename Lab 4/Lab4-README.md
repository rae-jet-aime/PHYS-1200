**Exercise 1:** Tuple for Vector Components
* **Objective:** Use tuples to represent 2D vector components.
* **Description:**
  * Ask the user to input the x and y components of a vector.
  * Store these components in a tuple.
  * Calculate the magnitude of the vector.
  * Print the components and the magnitude.
  
**Exercise 2:** List of Prime Numbers
* **Objective:** Create a list of prime numbers and perform various operations on it.
* **Scenario:** Let's say we want to create a list of the first few prime numbers and then perform some basic operations like adding new primes, accessing elements, and combining with another list:
  * 1 - Create a list of the first 5 prime numbers.
  * 2 - Add a few more.
  * 3 - Access the first and last prime numbers of the list.
  * 4 - Create a new list containing only the first three prime numbers.
  * 5 - Combine the list of prime numbers with another list of primes.
  * 6 - Reversing the List.

**Exercise 3:** Weight on a Planet
* **Objective:** Use a dictionary to store “g” for each planet, then calculate the
weight on a given planet.
* **Description:**
  * Create a dictionary including the eight planets as keys and their value for g as values.
  * Get the mass of the user in kg and their desired planet.
  * Use the planet the user enters to extract the value of its g from the dictionary and return the weight of the user on that planet.
