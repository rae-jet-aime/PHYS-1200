**Coding practice 1:** Suppose an object starts from rest and accelerates uniformly. If the acceleration is *a* and the time for which this acceleration is applied is *t*, write a code that takes *a* and *t* from the user and
prints the final position *s* of the object.

**Coding practice 2:** A ball is thrown upwards with an initial velocity of *v*. Write a code that takes *v* from the user and prints the maximum height it reaches. Assume acceleration due to gravity *g* is 9.8 meters per second squared (downwards).
  
**Coding practice 3:** A box of mass *m* is sliding on a surface with a coefficient of kinetic friction *uk*. Write a code that takes *m* and *uk* from the user and prints the force of friction acting on the box. Assume acceleration due to gravity. Make sure your code is nice and has enough comments.
